      <p>I'm a currently pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering at the <a class = "link" href = "https://uci.edu/" target = _blank>University of California, Irvine</a>. I transfer to this university this fall from the <a class = "link" href = "https://www.ccsf.edu/" target =_blank>City College of San Francisco</a> where I obtained my AS in computer science, graduating with the highest honors and making on the dean's list. </p>
      <p>My interests include computer architecture, embedded systems, and any other type IoT. I have experience in C++, Python, and Java, and I am currently learning frontend programming such as html, css, and js. I enjoy working on projects that challenge my problem-solving skills and improve my or others day to day life.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in any opportunity that helps broaden my horizons in the field, whether through internships, research, or collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me through my contact page if you'd like to connect or work together.</p>
